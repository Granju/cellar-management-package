# Cellar management package

## About the cellar management package

This project has been developped as part of my data science training, so its main reason for being was for me to pratice my object-oriented development. The package has been designed to help with the management of a wine cellar. It is meant to help with keeping track of bottles in ones cellar and to be able to easily find some bottles based on specific characteristics.
